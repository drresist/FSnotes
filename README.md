# F# Notes


My notes / code snippets during learning FP / F#

Learning based on books, courses, fail & wins :) 

Terms: 
* Higher order functions - function which takes one or more functions as args
* Type-test operator - if error after :? reproduced -> next action after arrow execute
* Inline parameter - compiler make copy of func each time they called
